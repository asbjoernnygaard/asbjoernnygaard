# Welcome to my github!

Hi! My name is AsbjÃ¸rn and I'm a fullstack java developer working as a consultant for SALT (School of Applied Technology). I've long had a passion for code, from interactive art and small games in p5.js and Processing, to ODE solvers in python during my time at university whilst taking a degree in Physics and Astronomy. Now my skillset is focused on fullstack applications, particularily webdevelopment.

I think the reason I love developing so much is because you're always in the process of learning. Be it a new framework, a new release of an older framework, new tools etc. there's always something new to tinker with and a goal of proficiency. This also reflects in my hobbies as I'm also in a constant process of developing there, e.g. a new piece on the piano.

Another aspect is the collaborative nature of development. I'm a social person and a teamplayer. There's nothing better than to work with other passionate developers on a project, fulfilling eachothers strengths and weaknesses, thus delivering an app that is so much grander than what one developer could achieve on their own.
